# Cipher-Decoding
Project from Machine Organization and Programming (completed spring 2021)

This program decodes cipher texts using the Caesar cipher technique. 
Left shifts are used to encode the message and right shifts are used to 
decode the ciphertext.   
The ciphertext is read from a file named "cipher.txt" that should be
present in the current working directory.    
The number of right shifts required to decode the message is calculated
using a (not so) secret key, the CS login of the intended recipient.
